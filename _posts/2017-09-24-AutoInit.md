title: Generating your `struct`'s `init`
---

### `struct`s default initializer

Swift has an awesome feature regarding `struct`s and their initializer. By default, an initializer is generated so you can create your `struct` with the content you want:

```swift
public struct Person {
    public let familyName: String
    public let givenName: String
}

let superDupont = Person(familyName: "Dupont", givenName: "Super")
```

You can do this as long as you are in the same module.  
However, if you try to instanciate the `struct`	from outside the module you'll have this error:

`'Person' initializer is inaccessible due to 'internal' protection level`

As indicated, it's because the `init` is `internal`, even if you've marked your `struct` as `public` like above.

Your only solution to access it is to write your own public initializer:

```swift
public struct Person {
    public let familyName: String
    public let givenName: String

    public init(familyName: String, givenName: String) {
        self.familyName = familyName
        self.givenName = givenName
    }
}
```

And now you have one more problem: you need to update this code every time your `struct` changes.

Wouldn't it be great if we did not have to write and maintain this code?

### Sourcery to the rescue

[`Sourcery`](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery) is a code generation tool using `SourceKit` which has several cool features to use in ths case:
- source annotations
- inline insertion of generated code

I have written a template to generate the `init` method of annotated `struct`s.
Here is how this works:

#### 1. Annotate the struct

You add `// sourcery: AutoInit` just before your declaration:

```swift
// sourcery: AutoInit
public struct Person {
    public let familyName: String
    public let givenName: String
}
```

#### 2. Add `AutoInit.stencil` to your Sourcery templates

Create a `AutoInit.stencil` file in your Sourcery templates folder with the following content:

{% assign openTag = '{%' %}
{% assign openSubst = '{{' %}
```swift
{{ openTag }} for type in types.structs %}
{{ openTag }} if type|annotated:"AutoInit" %}
{{ openTag }} set spacing %}{{ openTag }} if type.parentName %}    {{ openTag }} endif %}{{ openTag }} endset %}
{{ openTag }} map type.storedVariables into parameters using var %}{{ openSubst }} var.name }}: {{ openSubst }} var.typeName }}{{ openTag }} endmap %}
// sourcery:inline:auto:{{ openSubst }} type.name }}.AutoInit
{{ openSubst }}spacing}}    {{ openSubst }} type.accessLevel }} init({{ openSubst }} parameters|join }}) { // swiftlint:disable:this line_length
{{ openSubst }}spacing}}        {{ openTag }} for variable in type.storedVariables %}
{{ openSubst }}spacing}}        self.{{ openSubst }} variable.name }} = {{ openSubst }} variable.name }}
{{ openSubst }}spacing}}        {{ openTag }} endfor %}
{{ openSubst }}spacing}}    }
// sourcery:end
{{ openTag }} endif %}
{{ openTag }} endfor %}
```

This template is also available as a [gist](https://gist.github.com/Liquidsoul/efa4f65af055acfde64afed6cda0007d).

#### 3. Run Sourcery

This will generate the `init` and insert the code right inside the `struct`'s declaration:

```swift
// sourcery: AutoInit
public struct Person {
    public let familyName: String
    public let givenName: String

// sourcery:inline:auto:Person.AutoInit
    public init(familyName: String, givenName: String) {
        self.familyName = familyName
        self.givenName = givenName
    }
// sourcery:end
}
```

The template use the [auto-inlining](https://cdn.rawgit.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery/master/docs/writing-templates.html#inline-code-generation) feature of Sourcery.  
It will take the code between the `inline:auto` annotations and put it directly inside the specified type and then update the code in place when it needs to change.

#### 4. Enjoy

You can now access this initializer from outside the module and every time you update the structure declaration, it will update itself (when you run Sourcery of course).
